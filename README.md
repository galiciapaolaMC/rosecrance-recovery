## Environmental Checks
The `.env` will be generated during the initial `Make Create` build. The `.env` file type has been added to the .gitignore and should never be committed to the repo.

## Local Installation
1. Clone this repository into a new project directory.
2. Create MAMP host and database for your new project, with the Document root pointing to the root of your new project. 
3. Run `make create` and follow prompts to generate the `.env` file:
    * `DB_NAME` - Database name
    * `DB_USER` - Database user
    * `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password
    * `DB_HOST` - Database host
    * `WP_HOME` - Full URL to WordPress home (https://mc-wp-starter.local)
    * `ACF_PRO_KEY` - License key in MC 1Pass vault.
    * `WPM_PRO_KEY` - License key in MC 1Pass vault.
4. Run `make project` to define the project theme name and remote repository.
    * `ENV_THEME` - Theme directory name
    * `REMOTE_REPO` - Remote repository URL (leave blank if no repository exists)
5. Run `make build` to install package dependencies in the theme and build our assets.
6. Access WordPress admin at https://mc-wp-starter.local/wp/wp-admin/
7. Save Permalinks to generate .htaccess file

## Building with make
Project build automation is handled with `make`. The `makefile` defined in the project root contains our set of rules to define the builds.

Available commands are listed below:
* `make help` Displays a list of all available commands, as well as a short description of their intended use.
* `make clean` Clears composers internal package cache.
* `make create` Will install all composer dependencies and rename starter theme to defined project name. Prompts for user input for generation of environment variables.
* `make deploy` Packages current state of the codebase and deploys to remote repo in `/wp` directory.
* `make dev` Renames `/wp/wp-config.php` file to be ignored by WordPress and fallback to our root config. This is to be used for local development.
* `make install` Installs composer dependencies.
* `make package` Builds working copies of themes and plugins within the `/wp` directory.
* `make prod` Rename `/wp/wp-config.php` file to be recognized by WordPress core installation in `/wp` directory.
* `make remote` Clones remote repository to /wp directory.
* `make update` Updates your composer dependencies to the latest version according to composer.json.
